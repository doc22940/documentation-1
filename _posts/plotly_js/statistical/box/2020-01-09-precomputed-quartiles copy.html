  Instead of using one of the built-in algorithms to compute quartiles, you might want to precompute the values of the quartiles. This could be because you have a large data set and computing quartiles at runtime would slow down your application, or if you want to use a different algorithm than the ones that are provided. In this case, omit the `quartilemethod` attribute and pass in the values you want to use directly.
