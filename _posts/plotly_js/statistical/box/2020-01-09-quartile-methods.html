  The `quartilemethod` attribute controls the algorithm that is used to compute quartiles for box plots.  

  - The *linear* algorithm uses the 25th percentile for Q1 and 75th percentile for Q3, as computed using method #10 listed at [http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v14n3/langford.html](http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v14n3/langford.html).  
  - The *exclusive* algorithm uses the median to divide the ordered dataset into two halves. If the sample is odd, it does not includes the median in either half.  
  - The *inclusive* algorithm also uses the median to divide the ordered dataset into two halves. However, if the sample is odd, it includes the median in both halves.
