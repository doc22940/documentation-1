				<h3>New to Plotly?</h3>

<p>Plotly&#39;s R library is free and open source!<br>
<a href="https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/">Get started</a> by downloading the client and <a href="https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/">reading the primer</a>.<br>
You can set up Plotly to work in <a href="https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/#hosting-graphs-in-your-online-plotly-account">online</a> or <a href="https://plot.ly/r/offline/">offline</a> mode.<br>
We also have a quick-reference <a href="https://images.plot.ly/plotly-documentation/images/r_cheat_sheet.pdf">cheatsheet</a> (new!) to help you get started!</p>

<h3>Version Check</h3>

<p>Version 4 of Plotly&#39;s R package is now <a href="https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/#installation">available</a>!<br>
Check out <a href="http://moderndata.plot.ly/upgrading-to-plotly-4-0-and-above/">this post</a> for more information on breaking changes and new features available in this version.</p>
